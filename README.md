# FacialOSA
This project implements a deep learning-based classification system for detecting Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) using facial landmarks and features. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to extract facial features and a neural network to classify subjects as either OSA or normal cases.
## Features
- Facial landmark detection using dlib
- Neck contour estimation
- Binary classification (OSA vs Normal)
- Real-time visualization of facial features
- Confidence score prediction
- Interactive Jupyter notebook implementation

## Prerequisites
Python 3.9 Download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat from dlib's official website
